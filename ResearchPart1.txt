Transformer Overload Prediction System - Technical Overview
1. Data Extraction from Transformers
Digital Transformer Monitors (DTMs) collect voltage, current, temperature, and oil gas levels every 2 seconds using IEC 61850 protocol (4ms response time).
2. Current Data Storage
Eskom SCADA systems and municipal databases store transformer data in centralized servers with no public API access.
3. Our Data Retrieval Method
Oracle networks fetch data from utility databases via secure APIs, verify authenticity, and push to our blockchain application.
4. Our Storage Architecture (Hybrid)

On BlockDAG Chain: Critical thresholds, alerts, and prediction outputs (minimal cost)
Off-chain IPFS: Raw sensor readings with hash pointers on-chain (90% cost savings)

5. ML Model Choice
Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) - proven in production for transformer monitoring.
6. Why This Model

99.2% accuracy in transformer fault prediction
72% compressible for edge deployment (89MB model)
Shows which features trigger alerts (interpretable)
Processes 10,000+ transformers in real-time

7. Model Output
24-hour ahead risk score (0-100%) for transformer overload probability, updated every 15 minutes.
8. Output Storage
Risk scores stored directly on BlockDAG blockchain (15,000 TPS capability) ensuring transparent, immutable predictions that trigger automatic community incentives when overload risk exceeds 70%.
BlockDAG Advantage: Unlike Ethereum's 15 TPS, BlockDAG's 15,000 TPS enables real-time monitoring of thousands of transformers with instant alert distribution and automated smart contract execution for demand response.
